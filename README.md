# :sparkling_heart::couple: Welcome to dating-analysis repository :couple::sparkling_heart:

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which explores the mystery behind finding a romantic patner, using the [Speed Dating Experiment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment) compiled by professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from Columbia Business School.

## Problem Definition

- what makes a person successful in finding a significant other?
- Are we able to predict if a person is getting a follow-up date after the first date?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Neural Network Regression

## Conclusion

In conlusion, it looks like there still is no real answers to the secret of love. It's not a particular hobby or interest, it's not attractiveness, intelligence nor any other traits. Really, it's just how much someone likes you. Eventhough our group can't give a step-by-step method on how to get a significant other, we can give some insights on how to increase your chances in succesful dates, which in turn will eventually lead to obtaining a girlfriend. 


These are our conclusion:
1. Since both genders are likely to enjoy the clich√© dinner and movie date, one should take your date there to get a higher chance of getting a girlfriend/boyfriend.
2. Men :male_sign: have it harder when it comes to dating as perhaps women:female_sign: can be pickier in their quest for love.
3. From the data, there are more participants which had unrequited love than those who had found love. Hence, don't feel too bad if you got rejected.:grin: This shows that the quest for love isn't a straight forward process and you need to try multiple times before finding the one. 
4. People still got rejected :broken_heart: regardless of their personality traits, such as attractiveness, so if you strike out, it's not you that is the problem but the other date partner.
5. Your impression of yourself is often wrong.:x:
6. There is no one trait that makes you likeable.
7. Being likeable is important in order to get a second date.
8. Whether logistic regression or neural network regression is better, ultimately it depends on the specific problem and data at hand.
